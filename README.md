## Getting Started

To get started, simply clone this repository, install the dependencies and start editing your presentation while editing `src/index.html` üòâ

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fluster/deckdeckgo
cd deckdeckgo
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Editing

To develop your presentation, simply edit `src/index.html` and add your slides using Ionic tags `ion-slide`.

Each `ion-slide` inside `ion-slides` is a slide of your presentation. Inside each `ion-slide` you could add and edit the content to display.

### Samples

For some more guidance, you could have a look to the following [samples](doc/samples/README.md).

### Lazy loading

If you wish to lazy load the images of your presentation, replace their `src` tags with `data-src`. The provided script [/src/scripts/lazy.js](https://github.com/fluster/deckdeckgo/blob/master/src/scripts/lazy.js) will take care of the lazy loading of the images when navigating through the slides.

```
<img data-src="assets/img/deckdeckgo.png"/>
```

## Theming

Theming a DeckDeckGo presentation is easy and quick.

Simply use the [Ionic Color Generator](https://beta.ionicframework.com/docs/theming/color-generator) to select the colors of your choice, `copy` the generated CSS variables, `parse` them into `src/css/variables.css` and voil√† üòÅ 

## Development

[lite-server](https://github.com/johnpapa/lite-server) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) are use to helps you during the development of your presentation.

In a terminal, start the following command to bundle your slides and to keep listening to modifications:

```bash
npm run watch
```

In another terminal, start a local server using the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Build

Once you are ready for your talk or ready to publish online your slides, run the following command in a terminal:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Before going online

Before your final build and before deploying online your slides, don't forget to edit the information regarding your presentation in the following files:

* Edit the meta tags in the `<head/>` of [src/index.html](https://github.com/fluster/deckdeckgo/blob/master/src/index.html)

* Generate your favicons and replace the respective files in the [assets](https://github.com/fluster/deckdeckgo/blob/master/assets/) folder. For that purpose I suggest you to use the real great tool [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net) 

* Update your information in the [manifest.json](https://github.com/fluster/deckdeckgo/blob/master/src/manifest.json) file

## Design and logo

The DeckDeckGo logo was designed and offered by [Anita](hello@skinque.com) from [Skinque.com](http://skinque.com), a great online marketplace for tattoos ü§ò

Reach her out if you are looking for a cool custom tattoo or a nice logo üòÉ 

## Backstory

I had the opportunity to talk about Web Components and Ionic. While I was developing my presentation it came to my mind that I was not really following what I was about to present, that's why I wrapped up together [DeckDeckGo](https://deckdeckgo.com), this new tool to create lightweight presentation using HTML and Ionic components.

Furthermore this project also allowed me to discover how to embed `@ionic/core` in a `index.html` and how to use it with vanilla Javascript.
